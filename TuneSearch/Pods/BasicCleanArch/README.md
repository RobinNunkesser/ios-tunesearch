Robert C. Martin's Clean Architecture is very helpful to write well structured and testable code. However, existing variants for mobile development are sometimes hard to understand for beginners or inappropriate for small projects. Basic clean architecture is a set of helpful protocols for the basic concepts of Clean Architecture like Interactors, Entities, Presenters, and Boundaries.
